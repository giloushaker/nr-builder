# Usage:
Open the executable

The initial page should show the systems from `{home}/BattleScribe/data` (can be changed in Options -> Development -> Change sytems folder)

If the system you want to use isn't in there, click "Add" and browse to a catalogue or gst, it will then import all the catalogues from the same folder

Click on the system you want to use (It may freeze for a bit while loading it)

Note:
This is only for testing data, not for making rosters/army lists.<br/>
For making army lists, its recommended to use the web version, available at https://newrecruit.eu
